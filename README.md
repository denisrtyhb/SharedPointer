# Smart pointers

Smart pointer is the helper entity, needed for dynamic memory management. The goal of this project is to write implementations of smart pointers, using basic tool of c++ language. 

Implemented pointers are : 
- SharedPtr(similar to std::shared_ptr)
- WeakPtr(similar to std::weak_ptr)
- UniquePtr(similar to shd::unique_ptr)
- IntrusivePtr
